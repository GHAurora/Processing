# Processing
Processing is a great introductory programming language that can make generative art, interactive art, and drawing.  https://processing.org/

Processing is a programming language about making visual art.  Processing is geared towards making interactive drawings with code.  It works on Android, iOS, GNU/Linux, Mac, and Windows.  Drawings can be generated from mouse movements, music frequencies, GPIO inputs, or web apis.  Processing is one of the easiest languages to learn.  Processing uses java syntax by default.  You can also use javascript live on webpages through p5.js.  Python syntax can also be used if enabled.

These are scripts I have made or modified using Processing:

Generative art using randomly moving triangles of random sizes.  These triangles have a calming and mesmerizing effect on the viewer.  As this script continues, the result becomes more unique and beautiful.  Run for an hour to multiple days.  Hold 's' to save images.

JitterRotate is an experiment with semantic errors.  Generative art using randomly moving triangles of random sizes, colors, rotation, and transparency.  This sketch only takes about 30 seconds to peak.  Hold 's' to save images.

![Screenshot](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/Processing/blob/master/Images/PaintWithShapes.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

Draw with squares, ellipses, and triangles.  Shapes have random fill color, stroke color, stroke width, and size.  WARNING: Contains flashing lights.  Hold 's' to save images.
