# Processing
Processing is a great introductory programming language that can make generative art, interactive art, and drawing.  https://processing.org/

These are scripts I have made or modified using Processing.  More to come!

Generative art using randomly moving triangles of random sizes.  These triangles have a calming and mesmerizing effect on the viewer.  As this script continues, the result becomes more unique and beautiful.  Run for an hour to multiple days.  Hold 's' to save images.

JitterRotate is an experiment with semantic errors.  Generative art using randomly moving triangles of random sizes, colors, rotation, and transparency.  This sketch only takes about 30 seconds to peak.  Hold 's' to save images.
